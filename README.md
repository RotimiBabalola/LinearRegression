# ML-Methods
This repository contains my implementations of the following algorithms for the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera:
 * Linear Regression (Using Gradient descent)
 * Logistic Regression (Using Gradient ascent)
 * K-Nearest Neighbours

Implementations of these algorithms using Python and R will also be added to this repository soon.
